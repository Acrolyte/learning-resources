# Machine Learning Resources

## Python (Must do first)

- First learn syntax of Python language
- Then move to learn different different libraries of python like numpy,pandas,matplotlib.
- [Numpy](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp)
- [Pandas](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)

## Machine Learning

- [Intro to Machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
- [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/common-machine-learning-algorithms/)
- [ML course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Preferred)
