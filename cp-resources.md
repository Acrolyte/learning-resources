# Competitive Programming Roadmap

- Select any particular language like C++, Java or Python ,its your choice, preferred is C++.
- First learn syntax of C++ like input output then learn about famous library of C++ i.e STL.
- [STL Resources by DSCKIET](https://github.com/dsckiet/dsc-important-links/tree/master/cp-resources/STL)
- Once you explored STL then select any particular topic like array, strings and solve questions of that topic from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) or [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) until you become comfortable with that topic, and do some ques of that topic from leetcode also.
- Try to give Biweekly contest on Leetcode , as they are good questions from basic.
- When you think that you have solved enough problems and you are very comfortable on basic topics then start learning graph from GeeksForGeeks like Breadth First Search and Depth First Search and once you are comfortable with it , search different algorithms of graph and try to understand them by solving questions related to them on LeetCode or GeeksForGeeks.
- And the Same concept apply on Dynamic Programming that is discussed above.

In starting sometimes you will not understand any question or any topic then you have give time i.e read again and again.

And if you are not able to solve any question then read the editorial of that question before skipping to next question.

In general Graph and DP are very important and interesting topics and the more number of questions you will solve the better you will get.
